Feature: Journey Detail API Implementation

  Scenario: Get journey detail with chapters and missions
    # Setup: Create journey with chapters and missions
    Given the database has a journey:
      | title            | 設計模式精通之旅                    |
      | slug             | design-patterns-mastery            |
      | description      | 用 C.A. 模式大大提昇系統思維能力      |
      | teacher          | 水球潘                             |
      | price            | 1999                               |
      | cover_image_url  | https://example.com/cover1.jpg     |

    And the database has a chapter:
      | journey_id   | {{lastJourneyId}} |
      | title        | 課程介紹           |
      | order_index  | 1                 |

    And the database has a mission:
      | chapter_id   | {{lastChapterId}}                      |
      | title        | 這門課手把手帶你成為架構設計的高手        |
      | type         | VIDEO                                  |

      | order_index  | 1                                      |

    And the database has a mission:
      | chapter_id   | {{lastChapterId}}                                                  |
      | title        | 你該知道：在 AI 的時代下，只會下 prompt 絕對寫不出好 Code              |
      | type         | VIDEO                                                              |

      | order_index  | 2                                                                  |

    And the database has a chapter:
      | journey_id   | {{lastJourneyId}}      |
      | title        | 架構思維的 C.A. 模式    |
      | order_index  | 2                      |

    And the database has a mission:
